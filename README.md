This is the example application created with Rails following along with the book 
[Agile Web Development with Rails 4](https://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4).
While I'd consider myself as having a good background knowledge of Rails it was good to really drill through
a full book like this and see how things *should* be done.

###I have a few things left to do to consider myself finished with the book:

- Chapter 15 Internationalization -- *Where I was in my Rails adventures didn't require me to worry about
internationalization yet,* **but I'm sure that day will come.**
- *Playtime* enhancements (other than those required later in the book)
- Chapter 16 Deployment -- *I'm currently using Heroku, but I'm exploring hosting on my "own" servers soon enough.*
- A more in depth look at chapters 19-25
